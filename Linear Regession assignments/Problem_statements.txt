1) Delivery_time -> Predict delivery time using sorting time 
2) Salary_hike -> Build a prediction model for Salary_hike

------------------------------------------------------------


Build a simple linear regression model by performing EDA and do necessary transformations and select the best model using R or Python.



 Ans:
 ->The simple linear regression model for Delivery_Ttime and Salary_hike was built.
-> By observing  R2 score of each model, we conclude that the Salary_hike  is the best model, with R2 score = 0.9569 = 95.69%.
